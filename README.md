# Hi Everyone! 

I am working on creating an e-commerce template site using [Commerce](https://commercejs.com/docs/). I figured this would be a perfect time to ask the dev community to help me since it is Hacktober fest. This will be a great opportunity to learn open-source and how to read new docs together. I look forward to coding with you.
